*  View all animes: *Displayes all the anime records currently stored in database.*
*  Filter animes by sport: *Shows anime records that match the entered sport type.*
*  Choose random anime to watch: *Selects a random unseen anime, which has finished airing.*
*  Mark anime as seen: *Asks the user to enter ID of an anime and marks it as seen;*
*  Delete anime: *Allows the user to enter ID of an anime, which they want to be deleted;*
*  Quit: *Closes The cursor and disconnects from the database.*
